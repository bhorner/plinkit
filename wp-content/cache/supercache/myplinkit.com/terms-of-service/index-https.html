<p><strong>Indemnification.</strong> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless against any losses, expenses, costs or damages (including our reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees, expert fees&#8217; and other reasonable costs of litigation or proceedings) arising from, incurred as a result of, or in any manner related to any claim or action based upon (a) your breach of, or failure to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and/or (b) your use of the Services. We may, in our discretion, participate in the defense of any such claim or action and any negotiations for its settlement or compromise. No settlement which may adversely affect our rights or obligations shall be made without our prior written approval. We reserve the right, at our own expense and on notice to you, to assume exclusive defense and control of any such claim or action and then your corresponding indemnification obligation will end.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law</strong>. The Services are created, operated and controlled by PLINKIT in the State of California, United States of America.

Use of the Services is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of this Agreement.</p>
